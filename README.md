Abstract: In the early stages of human decomposition, blow flies interact with the remains to lay eggs and acquire nutrients, and in the process they bring their microbes with them. While it is known that blow flies have their own unique core microbiome, it is not known whether this differs from that of blow flies in a decomposition environment. Differences in the blow fly microbiome may influence the types of microbes transmitted from the flies to the cadaver, therefore potentially affecting assembly of the human decomposer microbiome. The first purpose of this study was to characterize the microbiome of blow flies associated with human cadavers by fly organ and season. This is because fly interactions with cadavers vary by season, and because it is likely that external fly organs (i.e., the labellum and tarsi) make more direct contact and are likely involved in increased mechanical transmission with the cadaver than internal organs such as the oocyte. The second purpose of this study was to determine if the blow fly microbes contribute to the human decomposer microbiome. To accomplish these aims, ten human cadavers were placed outdoors across five seasons and allowed to decompose. The first waves of colonizing flies were collected and dissected by organ (labellum, tarsi, and oocyte). In addition to fly collections, samples from the cadavers were collected using a sterile swab at sites including the face, inner cheek, bicep, torso, and anus for feces. Overall, it was shown that the previously defined universal fly microbiome persists even in a decomposition environment, yet there were still notable differences between fly organs and seasons. We also found that there is a two-way transmission of microbes between flies and humans, as blow flies can pick up human-derived bacteria from the cadaver, and they can also substantially contribute to the human decomposer bacterial community.
